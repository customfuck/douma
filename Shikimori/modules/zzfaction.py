Yeah precisely, that's why factions exist.\n\n\n1) Have a competitive spirit\n2) Tournaments\n3) Play for pride and glory\n\nFactions are basically a team.\n\n\nThe reason Factions were created was to encourage the spirit of competition and teamwork among the players. Also to help newbies get guidance from some of the experienced players in HeXa and get rivals from the same and other factions to compete against and get stronger. \n\n\nEach faction is lead by a captain that will guide you to achieve greatness.\n\n\nBeing in any of the Offical Factions allows you to be eligible for participating in the HeXa tournament. We hold competition and tournaments ever now and then and each of the tournament has a different theme to it. Factions fight against each other for gaining points. The Faction with highest points is crowned champions and are awarded for the same.** \n\n"
